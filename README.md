# Gymshark Automation Task

SENIOR QA AUTOMATION ENGINER - TASK

As an automation engineer, you are a key player in creating the test automation frameworks for our products sometimes from scratch and on occasion editing and improving our current tech stacks. It’s an exciting time to join the QA Engineering function, as automation is going to be a part of our journey for the rest of the year and beyond. 
Context
As explained during previous interview stages, we are currently reviewing our tech stacks and reviewing the offering to decide on which stack to use on each project, some of the current considerations are Selenium Webdriver with a programming language of Java, Python or JavaScript and Cypress.io. For this task we are providing you with an IntelliJ project with the Java language, Selenium Webdriver and BDD Cucumber configured. 
However please feel free to provide your own project with any of the tech stack configurations mentioned above. We are truly in a forming stage with test automation, and we are all here for new or additional suggestions to the tech stacks and approaches.
